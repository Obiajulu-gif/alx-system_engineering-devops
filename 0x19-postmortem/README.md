Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Outage
Issue Summary
Duration of the outage: June 10, 2024, 14:00 - 17:30 (UTC+1)

Impact: The primary web service experienced a significant slowdown, leading to an average page load time increase from 2 seconds to 15 seconds. Approximately 70% of users were affected, with numerous complaints about timeouts and slow responses. E-commerce transactions dropped by 50% during this period.

Root Cause: A memory leak in the backend server caused by an infinite loop in a newly deployed feature that handled dynamic CSS class rendering in React.js.

Timeline
14:00: Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating high memory usage on the backend server.
14:05: Engineers noticed a spike in user complaints on the support channel about slow response times.
14:10: Initial investigation started focusing on database performance and network latency.
14:30: Database team confirmed no issues; attention shifted to backend server performance.
15:00: Backend logs reviewed, revealing high memory consumption but no clear source identified.
15:30: Misleading assumption that the issue was related to a recent database schema change.
16:00: Escalation to the full-stack development team.
16:15: Detailed code review initiated, focusing on recent changes deployed to production.
16:45: Infinite loop in the dynamic CSS rendering feature identified as the root cause.
17:00: Code fix implemented and deployed.
17:30: System performance returned to normal, and monitoring alerts ceased.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The issue was caused by a memory leak due to an infinite loop in the code handling dynamic CSS class rendering in React.js. The loop continuously allocated memory without releasing it, leading to progressively increasing memory usage and eventual server slowdown.

Resolution: The problematic code was identified during a detailed review of the latest deployment. The infinite loop was caused by improper state management in the React component. The code was refactored to ensure proper state updates and prevent the loop. After implementing the fix, the updated code was deployed to the production environment, resolving the memory leak and restoring normal service performance.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Enhance code review processes to include thorough testing for potential infinite loops and memory leaks.
Implement more robust monitoring and alerting mechanisms for memory usage and server performance.
Increase automated testing coverage, particularly for new features affecting critical parts of the system.
Task List:

Patch backend server: Apply the code fix to all environments (development, staging, production).
Add memory usage monitoring: Implement detailed monitoring for memory usage on backend servers to detect anomalies early.
Conduct training: Organize a workshop for developers on state management in React.js to prevent similar issues in the future.
Improve testing: Enhance automated test suites to include scenarios for detecting infinite loops and memory leaks.
Code review guidelines: Update code review guidelines to emphasize the importance of state management and memory handling.
Deploy review process: Introduce a mandatory code freeze period before deploying major features to allow for comprehensive testing and review.
